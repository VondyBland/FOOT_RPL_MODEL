# FOOT_RPL_MODEL
In this work, we will consider how significant the dependence of the number of points scored, that is, what place the team took, on the basic sports factors, modern indicators and measurement systems and the cost of players in the club on the example of the Russian Premier Football League.
Short intro into parameters:
1) xG (Expected Goals): xG is a statistical metric used in football to measure the probability or expected number of goals that can be expected from a specific shot. It takes into account various factors such as shot location, angle, distance, and other contextual variables to provide a quantitative assessment of goal-scoring chances.
2) xGA (Expected Goals Against): xGA is a statistical measure that estimates the expected number of goals a team is likely to concede based on the quality of chances their opponents create. Similar to xG, xGA considers factors such as shot location, angle, distance, and other contextual variables to assess defensive performance.
3) DC : DC represents the number of passes made within a radius of 18 meters from the opponent's goal, excluding crosses. It is a metric used to measure the quality of positional play and indicates the ability to create scoring opportunities in dangerous areas of the field.
4) ODC: ODC represents the number of passes made by the opposing team within a radius of 18 meters from their own goal. It is an indicator of how well the analyzed team defends positionally. ODC measures the ability of the analyzed team to limit their opponents' scoring opportunities in dangerous areas near the opposition's goal.
5) PPDA (Passes Per Defensive Action): PPDA is a metric that measures the intensity of a team's pressing or defensive pressure. It calculates the average number of passes made by the opponent before a defensive action (such as a tackle, interception, or foul) is executed by the pressing team. A low PPDA value indicates high pressing intensity.
6) OPPDA (Opponents' Passes Per Defensive Action): OPPDA is the counterpart of PPDA. It measures the average number of passes made by the opposition team before a defensive action is taken by the analyzed team. A high OPPDA value suggests that the analyzed team allows their opponents more passes before engaging in defensive actions.
7) TEAM_VALUE: TEAM_VALUE represents the monetary valuation or worth of a football team. It takes into account various factors such as player market values, assets, revenue streams, brand value, and overall financial strength of the club to estimate the total value of the team as an entity.

The rest is presented in the work itself.
